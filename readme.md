# WeatherWidget

WeatherWidget is a modern web application that provides real-time weather updates. Built with TypeScript, DaisyUI, and TailwindCSS, this app allows users to search for weather conditions in any location. Users can also set a default location to automatically receive weather updates each time they load the application. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data and the Geocoding API for location lookups.
